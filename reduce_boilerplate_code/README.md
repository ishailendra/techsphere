# reduce_boilerplate_code
This is a POC project to show different methods of reducing boilerplate code in Java Application.

In this POC two methods of reducing boilerplate codes are showcased:
  1. Project Lombok
  2. MapStruct

## Project Lombok
Java library that helps in reducing boilerplate code like getter, setters, constructors. The injected code is immediately available for use in your application. Lombok has different annotation to reduce the boilerplate code. Some common annotations used are 
```
@Data
@Getter @Setter
@@AllArgsConstructor
@ToString
@EqualsAndHashCode 
```

## MapStruct
MapStruct is a code generator that helps in the implementation of mapping between Java bean types. The generated mapping code uses plain method invocations and thus is fast, type-safe and easy to understand.
